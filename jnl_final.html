			<h5>FBI data show the number of arrestees convicted for rape is up. The rape kit testing backlog may have increased these numbers since over 11,000 untested kits were discovered in Detroit, Michigan dating back to 1984.</h5>

			<p>Nearly 300 more arrests were recorded by Michigan State Police in 2019 than in 2009, according to FBI yearly reports. This represents almost a 34% increase in the total number of rape convictions over the ten-year period. However, it is likely that the number of arrests made for rape increased due to the investigation of untested rape kits that were found in a Detroit Police Department storage room. This investigation consisted of rape kits that were untested between the years 1984 and 2009; the review of these kits started in 2009 and ended in 2019. Not only did this result in a spike in arrests for rape, but also raised awareness for states to implement reform laws surrounding timely rape kit testing.</p>

					<h3>What is a rapekit?</h3>
					<p>The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting system identifies rape offenses for each “victim of rape, attempted rape, or assault with intent to rape, regardless of the victim’s age.” Due to the controversial nature of rape convictions DNA testing has been highly dependable since the late 1900s. Sexual Assault Rape Kits or SAKs are forensic examinations that collect any DNA, and document any other valuable evidence, left behind from the assailant on or inside the victim; these tests can be performed on both female and male victims. This also includes documentation of any injuries from the attack. Biological evidence such as saliva, blood, semen, urine, skin cells, and hair are taken by swabbing the victim’s skin, genitalia, anus, and mouth, and scraping underneath fingernails and combing through the victim’s hair. Then the evidence is labeled, packaged, and sent to the state’s forensic lab for review. These tests often reveal strong evidence to support a sexual assault or rape victim if they choose to report the crime to the police and seek justice. However, SAKs can only be used in helping a victim bring their perpetrator to justice if the evidence is analyzed and returned within a timely manner from the labs; otherwise, the conviction process is elongated, often creating more trauma for the victim and leaving the perpetrator free, putting others at risk.  
</p>
					<p>Over recent years it has been discovered that an abundance of SAKs were being left unanalyzed in state labs, which may be the reason for the spike in rape convictions, as they have since been processed as concrete evidence. This is especially evident in SAK testing data from Michigan. In 2009, Wayne County Prosecutor Kim Worthy began leading an operation to process an abundance of untested rape kits found in Detroit Police storage which uncovered 11,341 untested kits. Since the review ended in 2019, the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office has been working to investigate the cases to identify and prosecute perpetrators of rape using this previously missing SAK evidence. According to the Detroit Rape Kit Project, the evidence has uncovered 224 convictions, with 4,122 investigations complete; nearly 200 kits are being actively investigated and 100 are still awaiting investigation as of September 7th, 2021. Although these SAK’s were stored and analyzed in Detroit, DNA from these kits has contributed to investigations in 40 states across the US.

					<h3>Many states have not yet enacted laws to help stop the country-wide backlog. From 2008 to 2019, there was less than a one percent increase in total number of convictions for rape in the US, according to the FBI’s yearly reports. 
</h3>
					<p>The investigations in Michigan amplified the problem of the SAK backlog, mainly prompting the incentive for reform laws surrounding SAK testing in the US. As of 2014, Michigan law requires police to send rape kits in for testing within 14 days of receiving them. From 2014, to 2019 there was nearly a 32% increase in total number of arrests for rape in Michigan according to the FBI’s yearly reports. Michigan implemented the first rape kit tracking system and

					legislation</a>
				in 2014 that helps keep labs and the state accountable for a secure and efficient analysis process of rape kits. While many states still have not enacted or renewed their rape kit testing laws, in 2019, 20 rape kit reform laws have been enacted in 16 states across the US, according to the Joyful Heart Foundation. This foundation advocates for victims by working to stop the backlog, and pushes states to implement reform laws that comply with their six pillars of legislative rape kit reform. Their six pillars include annually documenting statewide inventory of untested kits, mandatory testing of backlogged kits and new kits, implementing a statewide tracking system, granting the victims’ rights to notice, and funding for reform. A press release published in 2019 by the Joyful Heart Foundation claims Michigan became the newest state in the country to adhere to their pillars and enact adequate rape kit reform after adding a new SAK tracking system to their state reform laws.</p>
					<p>“Mandating the swift testing of every sexual assault kit sends a powerful message to survivors that they—and their cases—matter. It sends a message to perpetrators that they will be held accountable for their crimes. It is also the pathway to a more effective criminal justice system and safer communities across the country,” said Ilsee Knecht, Director of Policy & Advocacy for Joyful Heart.
